ex00 >> first create a directory "ex00" in your repo using <mkdir> => mkdir ex00
        then create a file "z" using <touch> or directly using vim => 1. touch z / 2. vim z, note: vim is much better :D
        now if you used <vim z> , a new page should pop out, this is the vim text editor it's much like a notepad.
        press i to get in the insert mode and then simply type the letter Z and to save the file press esc to escape the insert mode,
        and then :wq or :x to save and exit.
        now to test your work use the <cat> command, this command is used to view a file's content, you're gonna need it for later ;)

ex01 >> after creating the ex01 directory as in the last exercise, create a file "testShell00" using touch 
        <touch testShell00>, now that your file is created use the command ls -l aka "list -long"
        this command is used to list all files and directories in your current directory " . ", and 
        the /flag/ -l is used to show the details of these files and directories, try < man ls>.
        
        """ -r--r-xr-x 1 XX XX 40 Jun 1 23:42 testShell00 """
        now let's see what this line means , first you can see a combo of 'r' 'x' 'w' and '-'
        these are permissions i suggest you watching this video to learn all about permissions 
        https://youtu.be/pYdB2uG9pnE?si=Wc3BOLUmSVJxpYGN  [1:22:09]
        I also suggest you to keep https://linuxjourney.com/ your friend in your Piscine journey
        go to https://linuxjourney.com/ >> command line >> ls (list directories)

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************************

ex02 >> this exercise is the same as ex01 but more annoying, as i told you use https://linuxjourney.com/ and you should be good.
        note: dont worry if you retried doing this exercise more than once :) .

ex03 >> SSH key is a type of access credential just like your passwords to access SSH servers,
        it's unique for each device, and you should add it to your intra account to access the git repostries to submit your work.  
        now to solve this exercise you have to search for your .ssh directory "it's a hidden file"
        and find your public key and paste it in the "id_rsa_pub" you've created in the ex03 direcrory.

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************************

ex04 >> now for this exercise you have to RTFM !! (Read the fuck**ng manual) using the <man> command 
        when using "man ls", search for the flags that do the following >> list all files and directories in your
        current directory (except for hidden files or any file that starts by a dot - yes, that
        includes double-dots), separated by a comma and a space, by order of modification
        date. Make sure the directoryâ€™s names are followed by a slash character.
        note: use vim midLS to place your command!

********************************************************************************************************************************************************************

ex05 >> in this exercise you have to also RTFM !! use "man id" :)
